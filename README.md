# School Performance Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of school performance based on various factors such as school type, size, spending, and grade-level performance. The analysis is conducted using Jupyter Notebook and includes comprehensive tables comparing math scores, reading scores, and overall passing rates.

## Content

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The `PyCitySchools.ipynb` notebook contains the analysis code along with every table analyzed. It provides detailed insights into school performance across different metrics.

- **Resources Folder**: The `Resources` folder includes the CSV files containing the necessary data for the analysis. These files are used within the Jupyter Notebook for data manipulation and visualization.

- **Written Report**: Additionally, a report in PDF format (`school_performance_written_report.pdf`) is included within the notebook. This report summarizes the analysis findings, conclusions drawn, and highlights key insights discovered during the analysis process.

## Summary

In the analysis, we explored various aspects of school performance, including comparisons between charter and district schools, the impact of school size on performance, and the relationship between student spending and overall passing rates. Each table within the notebook compares math scores, reading scores, and overall passing rates, providing a comprehensive view of school performance across different metrics.

## Conclusions

The analysis conducted reveals significant disparities in performance between charter and district schools, with charter schools consistently outperforming district schools across various metrics. Additionally, smaller and medium-sized schools tend to perform better than larger schools, and there is a clear correlation between lower student spending and higher overall passing rates.
